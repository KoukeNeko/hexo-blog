# Welcome to My Personal Blog! ðŸŽ‰

Hello everyone! I'm excited to launch my new personal blog built with **Hexo** and a custom dark theme inspired by modern web design.

## About This Blog

This blog will serve as a platform where I share my journey as a computer science student at CCU. You can expect to find:

- **Programming tutorials** and tips
- **Project showcases** from my studies and personal work
- **Thoughts on technology** and the tech industry
- **Learning experiences** and challenges I face

## About the Design

The theme you're seeing is inspired by modern dark designs with:

- âœ¨ **Smooth animations** and interactive effects
- ðŸŽ¨ **Beautiful typography** using Inter and Geist fonts
- ðŸ“± **Responsive design** that works on all devices
- ðŸŒ™ **Dark theme** that's easy on the eyes

## What's Next?

I'm planning to write about various topics including:

1. **Web Development** - Frontend and backend technologies
2. **Data Structures & Algorithms** - Learning notes and explanations
3. **Personal Projects** - Showcasing things I build
4. **Career Journey** - My path in computer science

Thank you for visiting, and I hope you'll find the content here useful and interesting!
